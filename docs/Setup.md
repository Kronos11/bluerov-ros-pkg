# Setup

The BlueROV software stack is built on [ROS](http://www.ros.org/), the Robotic Operation System. We are building off of the current version of ROS, codenamed Indigo Igloo.

## ROS Installation

The following instructions will help you get a vanilla version of ROS Indigo Igloo installed on both

### Workstation

For first time ROS users, we highly recommend installing the Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine images with ROS Indigo Igloo preinstalled by Nootrix. Choose the 64-bit version if your machine has the resources to support it, otherwise use the 32-bit version. To install using this method, please do the following:

1. visit the [Nootrix blog post](http://nootrix.com/2014/09/ros-indigo-virtual-machine/) on the subject
1. download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and the VirtualBox Extension Pack for your host machine
1. download one of the ROS [virtual machine images from Nootrix](http://nootrix.com/downloads/#RosVM)
1. open VirtualBox, choose File > Import Appliance and then select the virtual machine image that you downloaded

### RaspberryPi

The ROS community maintains excellent instructions on getting [ROS to run on a RaspberryPi](http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi). Follow those and you should be good to go.
