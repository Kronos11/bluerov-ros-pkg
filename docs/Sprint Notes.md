# BlueROV ROS Sprint

A one-week sprint is being held to kick off the development of the BlueROV software. The goal of this sprint is to create a ROS package for the BlueROV that provides a solid foundation for community members to build on.

Our primary concerns are:

* Interoperability with existing ROS tools
* Robust, closed-loop maneuvering
* Low-latency, real-time video
* Lowest possible learning curve for community members with custom sub configurations
* Complete documentation such that a community can get fully up and running with their own BlueROV

## Monday

* Get the same version of ROS up and running on a RasberryPi and Joshâ€™s Macbook
* Aim to use a virtual machine image with ROS pre-installed to make adoption easy for community * members
* Compile and run a custom, bare-bones binary on both machines to ensure proper installation

## Tuesday

* Complete percentage-based control from an Xbox controller all the way through the APM to the speed controllers
* DRY TEST: ensure proper output for all six thrusters from controller input
* DRY TEST: ensure adequate real-time video using raspicam_node or similar

## Wednesday

* Broadcast IMU message from the APM to ROS
* DRY TEST: ensure proper IMU output by rotating and translating the ROV in all directions
* Create an auto-calibration program that users can run for any sub configuration
    * This program should output test data and the config files for closed-loop control

## Thursday

* WET TEST: open-loop calibration pool test
    * goal is to get imu measurements for:
    * +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, -z movements at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% thrust
all six rotation speeds in the same increments as above
* Add IMU feedback into the control loop using acquired data

## Friday

* DRY TEST: ensure property output for all six thrusters based solely on IMU input
* WET TEST: closed-loop control test using real-units


## Sprint 2

* Get point to point Ethernet working
* Compile the rasberrypi camera driver on Ubuntu to get video working again
* Work on the URDF file including transforms for thrusters and sensors
* Possibly try to extract the solidworks models for key components to display in rviz (otherwise use geometric stand-ins)
* Write a quick program to add "markers" to rviz to view commanded thruster values in 3D
* Show orientation of sub in rviz
* Publish odometry data from thruster commands (should be able to see full movement in rviz now)
    * add time-trail in rviz to see position over time
* Get the EKF working with IMU and odometry
* Start on the closed-loop orientation stuff
    * decouple motion
    * position hold
* Start on the auto-gain determination from thruster configuration (URDF)
    * (there will still be a layer of manual gains on top of this)
* Better documentation for using the library with a custom robot
    * how to set up the URDF
    * simple teleop control vs auto-gain determination from URDF
    * open-loop controller vs closed-loop controller
